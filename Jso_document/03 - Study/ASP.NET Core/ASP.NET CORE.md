Usually, developer machine uses MAC or Windows, server machine use LINUX, and on server machine there should be a software which receives request and provide response (Called reverse proxies)

If we create model controller view pattern it’s called [**ASP.net](http://ASP.net) core MVC**
but if we only create controller, model but no view, it’s called **[ASP.net](http://ASP.net)core API** (use to create restful services, so that it can receive requests and provide the data as response, so we can use any front end framework)
