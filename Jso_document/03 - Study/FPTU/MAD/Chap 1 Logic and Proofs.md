# <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">1.1</mark> Propositional Logic propositional

A <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">propositional</mark> is a declaration sentence that is either true or false.
Ex: Which of the following sentence are propositional
+ Great (propositional)
+ Tokyo is the capital of Japan (propositional)
+ What time is it (not propositional)
+ It is now 3pm (propositional)
+ 1+7=9 (propositional)
+ x+1=3 (propositional)

## Compound Proposition

Let p,q be propositions.
### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Negation</mark> ($\neg$)

(phủ định)
This is negation: $\neg$p
$\neg$p = not q = proposition that is true if p is false, and is false if p is true.

### <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Conjunction</mark> ($\land$)

(Can be called and) - (Sự Giao Hội)
This is conjunction: p$\land$q
p$\land$q = "p and q"
p$\land$q = "p and q" = proposition that is true when both p and q are true, and is false otherwise.

### <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Disjunction</mark> ($\lor$)

(Can be called or) - (Sự phân ly)
This is Disjunction: p$\lor$q
p$\lor$q = "p or q"
p$\lor$q = "p or q" = proposition that is false when both are false, and is true otherwise.

### <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Exclusive or</mark> ($\oplus$)

(Can be called xor) - 
This is Exclusive or: p$\oplus$q
p$\oplus$q = "only p or only q"
p$\oplus$q = "only p or only q" = proposition that is true when exactly one of p and q is true and is false otherwise.

### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Conditional statement</mark> ($\rightarrow$)

(Can be called: then, if, is sufficent for, is a necessary condition for, only if)
This is Conditional statement: p$\rightarrow$q
p$\rightarrow$q = proposition that is false when p is true and q is false, and is true otherwise.

### <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Biconditional statement</mark> ($\leftrightarrow$)

(Can be called If and only if)
This is Biconditional statement: p$\leftrightarrow$q
p$\leftrightarrow$q = proposition that is true when p and q have the same truth values, and is false otherwise.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Example 1:</mark> I watch soccer only if Arsenal play or I have no homework.

p = "I watch soccer"
q = "Arsenal play"
r = "I have homework"

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Example 2:</mark>
(a) You cannot pass this class if you miss more than 20% of lectures.
p = "You pass this class"
q = "You miss more than 20% of lectures"

(b) You cannot pass this class if you miss more than 20% of lectures unless you provide reasonable excuses. 
r = "You provide reasonable excuses"

## Logic and Bit Operations

Computers represent information using bits. A bit is a symbol of two possible values, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">0 and 1</mark>.

A bit can represent a truth value, that is:
+ 1 represents T (true)
+ 0 represents F (false)

Information is often represented using bit strings, and operations on bit strings can be used to manipulate this information.

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Example:</mark> 1001100 $\land$ 0011001 = 0001000.

# <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">1.2</mark> Propositional Equivalences

A compound proposition is called a <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">tautology</mark> if it is always true regardless of the truth values of the propositions that occur in it. 

A compound proposition is called a <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">contradiction</mark> if it is always false. 

A compound proposition that is neither tautology nor contradiction is called a <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">contingency</mark>.

Two propositions p and q are <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">logical equivalent</mark> if the biconditional statement p$\leftrightarrow$q is a tauatology.
