### 1. 

I agree with using Extreme Programming (XP) for this project.

Main practices and principles of XP:

- Short release cycles: XP uses short and quick development cycles, good because the first version must be ready in 3 months.  
      
    
- Simple design: Only design what is needed now, fits because the system is new and may change a lot.  
      
    
- Continuous testing: Always test the code, matches the manager's requirement to test from unit to system level.  
      
    
- Customer collaboration: Customer feedback is important, good because users like sales staff and finance staff will use the system.  
      
    
- Pair programming: Two developers work together, helps improve code quality because the system needs high reliability.  
      
    
- Collective ownership: Everyone can improve any part of the code, helpful when many departments join.  
      
    
- Sustainable pace: Developers work at a steady speed, important because project must finish in 6 months with high quality.  
      
    
- Refactoring: Improve the code when needed, good because the system must handle large datasets and be efficient.  
      
    

Project characteristics match XP:

- Tight timeline (3 months, 6 months total)  
      
    
- Need flexible changes  
      
    
- High quality and security needed  
      
    
- Many users and departments involved  
      
    
- Team has skilled developers  
      
    

  

### 2. 

- Unit Testing:  
    Test small parts of the code (such as functions or classes) to make sure the program structure is correct.  
      
    
- System Testing (including Integration Testing):  
    Test the full system after all parts are connected together, based on the functional requirements, to make sure the system works correctly as expected.

Functional Requirements:

1. Customers can select steel types.  
      
    
2. Customers can place orders online.  
      
    
3. Customers can track order status.  
      
    
4. Sales staff can accept or reject orders.  
      
    
5. Financial staff can track payments and debts.  
      
    

Security Requirements:

1. Encrypt customer information.  
      
    
2. Encrypt payment details.  
      
    

Performance Requirement:

1. Handle large datasets with high memory and CPU efficiency.  
      
    

Usability Requirements:

1. Easy for users to learn without official training.  
      
    
2. Provide a clear user manual.  
      
    

  

### 4. 

  

1. As a customer, I want to select the type of steel so that I can place an order.  
      
    
2. As a customer, I want to track my order status so that I know when my order is completed.  
      
    
3. As a sales staff, I want to view and accept/reject orders so that I can manage customer requests.  
      
    
4. As a financial staff, I want to track customer payments so that I can make debt reports.  
      
    
5. As a user, I want a simple user manual so that I can use the system without training.  
      
    

  

### 5. 

 a) What is velocity?  
Velocity is the amount of work (story points) a team finishes in one iteration (one sprint).

b) What is story point?  
Story point is a number to show how big or hard a user story is.

c) If total 120 points, velocity is 20 points → how many iterations?  
Iterations = 120 / 20 = 6 iterations.
