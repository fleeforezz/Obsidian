### 1. 

I agree with my manager to use Extreme Programming (XP) for this project.

XP main practices and principles:

- Frequent releases: Small updates are delivered quickly, good because we must release the first version in 3 months.  
      
    
- Simple solutions: Only build what is needed, fits because requirements may change during development.  
      
    
- Constant testing: Write tests early and test often, matches the project need for strong testing from unit to system level.  
      
    
- Customer feedback: Always ask customers for feedback, useful since many teams (sales, accounting) will use the system.  
      
    
- Pair work: Two developers coding together makes fewer mistakes, very important for secure and reliable system.  
      
    
- Shared code ownership: Anyone can update any part of the code, important when many people work together.  
      
    
- Keep steady work speed: No overworking, ensures team can finish good work in 6 months.  
      
    
- Refactor code often: Clean and improve code regularly, needed for a fast and high-performance system.  
      
    

Project fit:

- Tight schedule (3 months and 6 months)  
      
    
- Need strong quality and security  
      
    
- Must handle changes quickly  
      
    
- Team with strong developers  
      
    
- Work between many departments  
      
    

  

### 2. 

- Unit Testing:  
    Focus on checking the internal structure and logic of individual modules or functions.  
      
    
- Integration and System Testing:  
    Focus on testing the full combination of modules based on the functional requirements to ensure the system behaves correctly.  
      
    

  
  

### 3. 

Functional Requirements:

1. Customers can create new steel orders online.  
      
    
2. Customers can check payment status for their orders.  
      
    
3. Customers can view past order history.  
      
    
4. Sales staff can view monthly sales.  
      
    
5. Financial staff can issue invoices to customers.  
      
    

Security Requirements:

1. Secure customer data using encryption.  
      
    
2. Log user actions for security tracking.  
      
    

Performance Requirement:

1. Fast system response even with large data sets.  
      
    

Usability Requirements:

1. The system should be easy to use without formal training.  
      
    
2. Provide user-friendly guides or help pages.  
      
    

  

### 4. Five User Stories

Answer:

1. As a customer, I want to create an online order so that I can quickly buy steel.  
      
    
2. As a customer, I want to check my payment status so that I know if my payment is complete.  
      
    
3. As a sales staff, I want to review and process orders monthly so that I can track my sales performance.  
      
    
4. As a financial staff, I want to generate invoices so that customers know what they need to pay.  
      
    
5. As a user, I want clear help guides so that I can understand how to use the system.  
      
    

  

### 5. 

a) What is velocity?  
Velocity shows how much work (in story points) a team can finish in one sprint.

b) What is story point?  
Story point measures how big or difficult a task is.

c) If total story points = 120, velocity = 20 → how many iterations?  
120 ÷ 20 = 6 iterations.
