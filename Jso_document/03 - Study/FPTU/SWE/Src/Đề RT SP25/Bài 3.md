### 1. 

  

I agree with using Extreme Programming (XP) for this project.

Main XP principles and practices:

- Short cycles: Deliver working software quickly, fitting the 3-month and 6-month deadlines.  
      
    
- Simple code: Build only what is necessary now, important because requirements may change during the project.  
      
    
- Continuous testing: Test code early and often, matches the need for checking both program structure and functions.  
      
    
- Frequent communication with users: Helps to adjust the system based on real needs of sales and finance departments.  
      
    
- Pair programming: Two developers work together to reduce errors and improve code quality.  
      
    
- Shared responsibility: Any team member can update the code, helping faster progress when different teams join.  
      
    
- Maintain a steady work pace: Avoids team exhaustion, ensuring good performance until the end.  
      
    
- Refactor code: Clean and improve code as development continues, important for long-term performance.  
      
    

XP fits because:

- Tight timeline  
      
    
- High need for flexibility  
      
    
- Many users and departments involved  
      
    
- Skilled, experienced developers available  
      
    

  

### 2. 

  

The managers ask the team to perform two levels of testing:

- Unit Testing:  
    This focuses on verifying the internal structure and code logic of each small part of the system, such as functions, methods, or classes.  
      
    
- Integration and System Testing:  
    After combining all modules together, the team tests the system as a whole to ensure it meets the functional requirements and works as users expect.

### 4. 

Answer:

1. As a customer, I want to search and choose steel types so that I can find the right product quickly.  
      
    
2. As a customer, I want to pay for my orders online so that the process is fast and easy.  
      
    
3. As a sales staff, I want to manage order approvals so that I can control which orders move forward.  
      
    
4. As a financial staff, I want to create financial reports so that I can monitor company income.  
      
    
5. As a user, I want simple instructions so that I can operate the system without needing training.  
      
    

  

### 5. Velocity and Story Point

Answer: a) What is velocity?  
Velocity is the number of story points that a team can finish in one iteration (sprint).

b) What is story point?  
A story point is a number showing the size, effort, or difficulty of a user story.

c) If total story points = 120, velocity = 20:  
120 ÷ 20 = 6 iterations.
