### 1. 

  

I agree that using the Extreme Programming (XP) model is a good choice for this project.

Main practices and characteristics of XP:

- Quick releases: Deliver features fast, which matches the need to release the first version in 3 months.  
      
    
- Design simplicity: Build only what is needed now, useful because project details can change later.  
      
    
- Test-driven development: Write tests before coding, ensuring the system is stable from small units to full functions.  
      
    
- Customer involvement: Regular talks with users to adjust features, important because many teams (sales, finance) will use the system.  
      
    
- Pair programming: Developers work in pairs to improve quality and catch mistakes early.  
      
    
- Collective code ownership: Any developer can update any part of the code, helping speed and teamwork.  
      
    
- Sustainable work: Keep a regular work pace to avoid fatigue, needed for a 6-month timeline.  
      
    
- Refactoring: Make the code better over time, keeping it clean and fast.  
      
    

Why XP fits:

- Fast deadlines  
      
    
- High quality needed  
      
    
- Many user departments  
      
    
- Team is skilled  
      
    

  

### 2. 

The managers want two levels of testing to be done:

- Unit Testing:  
    Each small part of the system is tested separately to make sure the internal logic is correct and matches the expected design.  
      
    
- Integration and Full System Testing:  
    After connecting all the parts together, the team must test the full system against the business requirements to confirm it behaves correctly from a user's point of view.  
      
    

  

### 3. 

Functional Requirements:

1. Customers can choose steel products and add to cart.  
      
    
2. Customers can submit their orders online.  
      
    
3. Customers can monitor the shipping and payment status.  
      
    
4. Sales staff can manage customer orders.  
      
    
5. Financial staff can view and manage customer debts.  
      
    

Security Requirements:

1. Protect customer data with encryption during storage and communication.  
      
    
2. Track all important user activities for security checks.  
      
    

Performance Requirement:

1. The system must quickly respond even with many users active at once.  
      
    

Usability Requirements:

1. System must be simple enough to use without needing training.  
      
    
2. Provide easy-to-follow help inside the system.  
      
    

  

### 4. 

1. As a customer, I want to browse and select steel items to buy.  
      
    
2. As a customer, I want to see my payment and shipping status so I can track my orders.  
      
    
3. As a sales staff, I want to accept or reject orders quickly to help customers faster.  
      
    
4. As a financial staff, I want to view a list of unpaid invoices to manage debts better.  
      
    
5. As a user, I want simple instructions inside the system so I can find help easily.  
      
    

  

### 5.: 

### a) What is velocity?  
Velocity is the total amount of story points a team finishes during one sprint or iteration.

b) What is story point?  
Story point is a value that shows how much work or effort a user story needs.

c) If project total = 120 points and velocity = 20 points:  
120 ÷ 20 = 6 iterations.
