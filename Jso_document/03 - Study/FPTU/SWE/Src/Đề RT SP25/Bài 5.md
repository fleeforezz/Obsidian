### 1. 

I agree with using the Extreme Programming (XP) model for this project.

Main practices and ideas of XP:

- Fast releases: Deliver small parts quickly, matching the need for a fast first version.  
      
    
- Simple design: Keep the system as simple as possible, making changes easier when requirements update.  
      
    
- Testing all the time: Test every part early, matching the manager’s need for strong checking.  
      
    
- Work closely with users: Regular feedback helps fit real needs from sales and accounting teams.  
      
    
- Two people coding together: Pair programming finds mistakes early and improves teamwork.  
      
    
- Everyone improves the code: Any developer can update any part to keep things moving fast.  
      
    
- Work at a safe speed: Avoid burnout by working steadily during the 6 months.  
      
    
- Clean code: Refactor often so the system stays fast and easy to maintain.  
      
    

Why XP is a good fit:

- Fast timelines  
      
    
- Changing needs  
      
    
- Many users  
      
    
- Skilled team members  
      
    

  

### 2. 

The managers expect two testing stages:

- Unit Testing:  
    Each small piece of code, like a function or module, is checked to make sure it works correctly inside itself.  
      
    
- Integration and System Testing:  
    After all parts are connected, the team tests how they work together and whether the complete system meets the functional requirements from the business.  
      
    

  

### 3. 

Functional Requirements:

1. Customers can view available steel products.  
      
    
2. Customers can place and confirm online orders.  
      
    
3. Customers can monitor payment and shipping progress.  
      
    
4. Sales staff can approve or deny orders.  
      
    
5. Finance staff can view debt reports.  
      
    

Security Requirements:

1. Encrypt sensitive data (customer details, payment info).  
      
    
2. Track all important actions taken by users.  
      
    

Performance Requirement:

1. Support large numbers of users at the same time with quick response.  
      
    

Usability Requirements:

1. System must be simple enough to use without needing a training course.  
      
    
2. Include in-app help for users when needed.  
      
    

  

### 4. 

1. As a customer, I want to see steel products so I can choose what to buy.  
      
    
2. As a customer, I want to monitor my payment and shipping so I know my order status.  
      
    
3. As a sales staff, I want to approve or reject orders so I can control the sales process.  
      
    
4. As a financial staff, I want to check debts so that I can remind customers to pay.  
      
    
5. As a user, I want easy instructions inside the system so I can learn by myself.  
      
    

  

### 5. 

a) What is velocity?  
Velocity is the number of story points the team finishes in one sprint.

b) What is story point?  
A story point measures how difficult or big a task is.

c) If the total story points are 120, and the team's velocity is 20:  
120 ÷ 20 = 6 iterations.
