**Project Background:**

Hoa Phat (HP Co) is the largest steel manufacturing company in Vietnam. The company has a wide distribution network throughout Vietnam as well as in some other countries such as the US and EU. Currently, the company has a distribution management system. However, this system lacks features that allow customers who are agents to order online. To improve the efficiency of distribution management as well as support leaders to grasp the order status in a timely manner, the company's Board of Directors decided to build an online ordering software system called Steel Online Order Processing (SOOP). This software system needs to provide features for customers to select steel types and place orders, track order status, and payment status for orders. In addition, customers can review order history and summarize the quantity of steel types purchased. For sales staff, the system allows sales staff to view detailed information, accept or reject orders, and view sales by month of the year. Financial accounting staff can track debts, invoice payments to customers and make debt reports. In addition to the functions provided to users, the SOOP system needs to be integrated with the company's ERP system to synchronize sales data and use Single Sign-on feature of the current systems.

In addition to the above requirements, the system needs to ensure information security such as encrypt sensitive data (e.g., customer info, payment details), log user actions for accountability and troubleshooting and comply with regulations like GDPR or CCPA. The system needs to ensure high reliability, scalability and performance - handle large datasets, use memory and CPU efficiency, requiring little training time to use. Users can use the manual without having to attend official training courses.

The SOOP is a new development system that HP Co has not had a similar system before, so there may be many changes during the development process. With the experienced resources of the HP Co's IT department, the HP Co's leaders intend that the project will be undertaken by the IT department and the development team participating in the project will include 3-5 extensive experience and skilled developers. In addition, other departments commit to sending employees to join the project team to support project completion with high quality.

Project Timeline:

HP Co’s leadership expects the first version of the system to be put into use within 3 months and the project needs to be completely completed within 6 months.

Questions:

1. Your team members have good skills and experienced. Your manager tells you that the Extreme Programming (XP) software development model should be used for the project.  
    Do you agree or not agree with your manager? Please list and explain all main practices/principles and characteristics of XP model and then match with project characteristics to support for your answer. (2.0 points)  
      
    
2. It is assumed that your managers require that the system must be tested from the small unit level to the level of whole system integrated. At the unit level, the testing must focus on the program structure. At higher level, the testing should base on functional requirements.  
    What type and level/stage of testing does your managers require your team to do? (1.0 point)  
      
    
3. List 5 functional requirements, 2 security, 1 performance and 2 usability requirements that have been discussed on the given description of this project. (2.0 points)  
      
    
4. Write 5 user stories based on your answers in question 3. (1.5 points)  
      
    
5. It is assumed that your team use velocity method to estimate the number iterations for the project, please answer the questions:  
      
    

- a) What is velocity?  
      
    
- b) What is story point?  
      
    
- c) If the estimated total story points of the project is 120 points, velocity of the project team is 20, then how many iterations will the project last? (2.0 points)  
      
    

7. Create a story map for “Place and Accept Order” activities in the above description of the project. (2.5 points)

Note:

- a) Each wrong answer will be deducted 0.1 point.  
      
    
- b) Below is a guideline on how to write the Story Map on EOS software.

Story Map Structure:

The Story Map structure is divided into 2 parts. Part 1 (A) will describe activities and user tasks. Part 2 (B) will describe user stories to be performed at each release. The structure is as follows:

---

### A. Activities and User tasks

1. <Activity 1 name>  
    1.1 <User task 1 of activity 1>  
    1.2 <User task 2 of activity 1>  
      
    
2. <Activity 2 name>  
    2.1 <User task 1 of activity 2>  
    2.2 <User task 2 of activity 2>  
      
    

...

---

### B. Releases

Release 1

- <List user stories corresponding to each user task that will be implemented in the first release>  
    1.1.1 User story 1 of user task 1 in activity 1  
    1.1.2 User story 2 of user task 1 in activity 1  
    2.1.1 User story 1 of user task 1 in activity 2  
    2.1.2 User story 2 of user task 1 in activity 2  
    ...  
      
    

Release #

- <List user stories corresponding to each user task that will be implemented in release #>  
    1.1.3 User story 3 of user task 2 in activity 1
