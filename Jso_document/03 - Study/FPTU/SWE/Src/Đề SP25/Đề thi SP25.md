**FPT University (FU) is one of the leading universities in software engineering training in Vietnam. The number of students enrolling has increased very rapidly in recent years. To improve the quality of training and management process, the FU’s Board of Directors plans to apply a new examination process. In order to apply the new process, FU needs to develop a new web system called Examination Management System (EMS). The new system must provide the following capability for the lecturers, students, examination staffs:**

a) For Lecturer:  
The system needs to provide the ability for lecturers to show the examination timetable. Lecturers can check in/out attendance for students joining the examination. Lecturers can create requests for reassign user, reset wifi password, or view examination code.

b) For Student:  
The system also provides the ability for students to view the examination timetable and checkout. They can also create a request to reset wifi password or change MAC address of their laptop...

c) For Exam staff:  
The system needs to provide functions that allow to create examination schedule, import the student list for each examination room and session, make statistics on examination hours conducted for each lecturer, and monitor students’ and lecturers’ request during the examination session.

In addition to the above requirements, the system needs to allow users to log in with the FU’s email account on the Gmail platform, ensuring information security. The system needs to ensure high reliability and performance – handle large datasets, use memory and CPU efficiently, requiring little training time to use. Users can use the manual without having to attend official training courses.

The EMS is a new development system that FU has not had a similar system before, so there may be many changes during the development process. With the experienced resources of the FU’s IT department, the FU’s leaders intend that the project will be undertaken by the IT department and the development team participating in the project will include 3–4 extensive experience and skills developers. In addition, other departments commit to sending employees to join the project team to support project completion with high quality.

FU leadership expects the first version of the system to be put into use within 3 months and the project needs to be completely completed within 9 months.
