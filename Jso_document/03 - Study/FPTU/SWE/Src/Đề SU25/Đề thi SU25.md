Masan Consumer (MC) company is one of Vietnam's leading consumer goods distribution
companies. The company operates a widespread network of convenience stores (CS) across the
country, particularly in big cities like Hanoi. To manage the convenience store chain more
effectively, the company's board of directors (BOD) decided to develop a "Convenience Store
Management Software -CSMS" to better tracking operations in the sales transaction process,
inventory replenishment process...
The sales transaction process is the most frequent and visible part of the store's daily
operations. When a customer selects products to buy, the cashier uses the software's point-of-sale
(POS) interface to scan item barcodes for checking out goods, which instantly retrieves the price
and product details from the inventory.
As items are scanned, the software calculates the running total. If the store is running
promotions or discount campaigns, the system automatically applies eligible discounts or loyalty
rewards to the transaction. The software supports various payment methods including cash,
credit/debit cards, and mobile wallets, ensuring a smooth checkout experience.
Once payment is processed, the software generates a detailed receipt that can be printed
or emailed to the customer. Simultaneously, the inventory count is updated to reflect the items
sold, ensuring real-time stock accuracy.
Behind the scenes, the transaction is recorded in sales logs, which feed into analytics and
reporting modules for future business insights. CS's managers can view financial and stocks
statistics reports.  
In addition to the above functional requirements, the system needs to allow staff users to
authenticate with the MC's email account on the MC Email platform. The CSMS must be designed
to be intuitive and easy to learn, even for staff with limited technical experience. The interface is
clean and consistent, with large, clearly labeled buttons for high-frequency tasks like scanning
products, processing payments,
and searching inventory. Icons and colors are
used
meaningfully green to confirm actions, red to indicate errors or warnings so staff can navigate
quickly without second-guessing.
The system should be optimized to handle peak transaction volumes without lag, even
during rush hours when multiple checkout counters are active. Scanning an item updates the POS
display almost instantly, and payment processing completes in seconds.
Inventory searches return results in under two seconds, even for stores with thousands of
product entries. The system can handle concurrent users across different terminals without
performance degradation, allowing multiple cashiers, stock clerks, and managers to work
simultaneously.
The CSMS is a new development system that MC company has not had a similar system
before, so there may have many changes during the development process. With the experienced
resources of the MC's IT department, the MC's leaders intend that the project will be undertaken
by the IT department and the development team participating in the project will include 3-4
extensive experienced and skilled developers. In addition, other departments commit to sending
employees to join the project team to support project completion with high quality. MC leadership
expects the first version of the system to be put into use within 3 months and the project needs to
be completely completed within 9 months.  
  
It is assumed that you are assigned to implement this project, you should read carefully
the above description of the project then answer these questions:
1. Your team members have good skills and experienced. Your manager tell you that
the Kaban process should be used for the project. Do you agree or not agree with
your manager? Please list and explain all main principles and characteristics (E.g.
Visualization, Evolutionary Change, Feedback loops...) of Kaban process and then
match with project characteristics to support for your answer (2.0 points).
2. It is assumed that your managers require that the system must be tested from the
small unit level to the level of whole system integrated. At the unit level, the testing
must focus on the program structure. At higher level, the testing should base on
functional requirements.
a. What type and level/stage of testing does your managers require your team to do
(0.7 point)?
b. Who do testing in each stage/level? Why do you think those people to be suitable
for testing? (0.3 point)?
3. List 5 functional requirements, 3 performance and 2 usability requirements that have
been discussed on the given description of this project. (2.0 points).
4. Write 5 user stories based on your answers in question 3. (1.5 point)
