Heathrow Airport Management System (Heathrow AMS) is a comprehensive software platform designed to oversee and streamline all operational facts of an airport - from the moment an aircraft lands until it departs again. Unlike airline-focused systems, an AMS manages both landside and airside process.

**Core capabilities include:**
+ **Flight scheduling & resource allocation**
   Handles arrival/departure schedules, gate and runway assignments, and ground equipment coordination in real time
+ **Passenger handling**
   Support check-in, boarding, border control, and seating systems - often integrating with departure control system (DCS) for boarding and manifest validation
